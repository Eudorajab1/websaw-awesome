# Another version of Main app this time using Voodoodal for db

### What is Voodoodal?

Voodoodal is best described and explained here: https://github.com/valq7711/voodoodal. 

In essensce it extends the standard pydal tremendously thereby giving us yet more flexibility when dealing with our databases.

Serious Cudos to valq7711 for developing and sharing this excellent package.
